Financial Chatbot Documentation
Overview
This streamlined financial chatbot is a simple, rule-based Python program designed to answer key financial questions about Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla (TSLA), and Apple (AAPL) for the fiscal years 2021â€“2023. The chatbot reads data from the provided Excel file (Financials_2021-2023.xlsx) and responds to a set of predefined queries using this data.

How the Chatbot Works
The chatbot loads and processes the financial data from the Excel file.

It uses if-else statements to match user queries to specific, predefined questions.

For each supported query, the chatbot extracts the relevant data for all companies for the year 2023 (or compares 2022 and 2023 as needed).

The chatbot prints clear, formatted answers to the user.

If a user asks a question outside the supported set, the chatbot responds with a polite message indicating its limitations.

What is the total revenue?
Returns the total revenue for each company for 2023.

How has net income changed over the last year?

What is the profit margin?
Calculates and returns the profit margin for each company for 2023.

Other queries
For any other question, the chatbot responds:
"Sorry, I can only provide information on predefined queries."
